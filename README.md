Fake fortune teller website:
This is a goofy project meant to make me laugh because I'm a big kid. The complaints form does not submit, on purpose, because I want to mess with the user. 
The fortunes are also less-than-useful.

----------------------

Feature requirements:
-A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)
-Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes
-Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout (used on homepage only)
- (maybe) Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format
-Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button). (Used on both Complaints and Fortune pages)
- (maybe) Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site
- (maybe) Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it
-Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list)
