# CodeLou
# Fake fortune teller website:
# This is a goofy project meant to make me laugh because I'm a big kid. The complaints form does not submit, on purpose, because I want to mess with the user. The fortunes are also less-than-useful.
# Feature requirements:
# Mobile responsive navigation menu
# Form that takes in at elast two fields of information and validates input
# JavaScropt function whose return value is used in your site
# Use ":nth-child" CSS to style a series of elements
