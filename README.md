Fake fortune teller website:
- This is a goofy project meant to make me laugh because I'm a big kid. The complaints form does not submit, on purpose, because I want to mess with the user. 
- The fortunes are also less-than-useful.

----------------------

Feature requirements:
- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes (used on homepage in multiple locations and used in header nav across site)
- Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout (used on homepage only in the Testimonials and Contact sections)
- Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button). (Used on both Complaints and Fortune pages)
- Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site (maybe? For the Fortune teller response, the javascript performs a math function in order to pull from an array then displays that on the page)
- Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it
- Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list)
